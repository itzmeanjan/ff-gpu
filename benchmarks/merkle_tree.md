## Benchmarking Merklization using Rescue Prime Hash on F(2 ** 64 - 2 ** 32 + 1)

Given N -many leaves of fully balanced Binary Merkle Tree, all (N-1) -many intermediate nodes are constructed by following two routines. Note, both of these approaches use Rescue Prime as underlying hash function for merging two child nodes into single immediate parent node. So an efficient Rescue Prime Hash function implementation boosts Merklization construction. Improvement suggestions/ ideas are welcome.
