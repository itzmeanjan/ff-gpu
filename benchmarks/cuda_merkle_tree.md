## Benchmarking Merklization using Rescue Prime Hash on F(2 ** 64 - 2 ** 32 + 1) with CUDA Backend

In benchmarking code, I construct all intermediate nodes of Binary Merkle Tree, where N -many leaves are provided. Each leaf is a Rescue Prime digest and Rescue Prime function `merge` is used for merging two children nodes & computing immediate parent node ( which is intermediate node, indeed ). Note, in all these case N must be power of 2. Each digest of Rescue Prime hash is 4 field elements ( i.e. 256 -bit ) wide. After Merklization (N - 1) -many intermediate nodes to be computed. 

I've applied three approaches in writing Merklization routine. Their underlying assumptions are similar, it's just that how work is distributed or more specifically speaking which work-item is orchestrated to do what is different along with whether Rescue Prime hash constants are read from global memory or cheaper scratch pad memory. Latest routine ( i.e. `approach 3` ) uses local scratch pad memory, otherwise it's very much same as what `approach 1` is.
