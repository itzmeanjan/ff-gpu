## Benchmark Rescue Prime Hash on F(2 ** 64 - 2 ** 32 + 1) Elements

I setup benchmarking with a 2D grid of work-items of dimension N x N, where N = {128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096}. Each work-item takes an input array of prime field elements of length 8 ( so 512-bit input ) and produces 256-bit output hash, consisting of four prime field elements.

`hash_elements` function is the only one benchmarked, with AOT compilation enabled for target platform, where workgroup size is set to **64**.

> Hash state is represented using register files, which is why I notice, on GPU performance is far superior than previous benchmark on GPU, while on CPU reverse trend is present. It makes sense because, on GPU, register files are larger than what it's in CPU. Note, at [commit](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ff-gpu/blob/27f670fa955b8e33a76741cd364a8dbae7fa1959/benchmarks/rescue_prime.md) benchmark results using indexable arrays, and compare it with current benchmark results. On CPU, too much use of registers, probably resulting into register spilling which puts state data on RAM and access becomes slower, which seems to be reason behind decreased performance on CPU, when indexable arrays are not used. *I intend to keep register based implementation, instead of indexable array based [one](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ff-gpu/blob/27f670fa955b8e33a76741cd364a8dbae7fa1959/rescue_prime.cpp), as my major interest is to get better performance when running on GPU.*
